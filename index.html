                Madeline is a girl who wants to climb Celeste Mountain to run away from her problems. Over the course of the game, she meets a host of characters including:
		<br>Theo, a social media influencer who is climbing the mountain to retrace the footsteps of his grandfather in the search of his own meaning, 
		<br>An old woman who acts as a voice of doubt for Madeline
		<br>Mr. Oshiro, who is a ghost who runs the Celestial Resort, and is plagued by self-doubt and an inability to move on.
		<br>The Part of Madeline, referred to by the fans as Badeline, who antagonizes Madeline and represents the part of her that she is trying to run from by climbing the mountain.

		Synopsis
	    </h2>
	    <p2>
		The story starts with Madeline crossing a bridge that crumbles behind her. She meets the old lady, who attempts to discourage her from climbing the mountain, but she presses on. Along the way, she meets Theo, who originally acts aloof and doesn’t respect Madeline very much, though he treats her like a kind stranger.
		<br>Eventually, Madeline comes across a mirror, where she meets Badeline. Badeline immediately assumes the role of the evil Doppelgängerin, creating copies of Madeline that chase her around the level, copying her every movement. Once Madeline escapes Badeline, she comes across a payphone where she receives calls from people in her past who invalidate her in subtle ways before she realizes the entire sequence up until this point was a dream. She meets Theo again, who in his lack of respect for Madeline, snaps a picture of her without her consent (in which she looks terrible).
		<br>Madeline continues her climb until she comes across the Celestial Resort, a hotel run by a ghost named Mr. Oshiro, who talks himself into attempting to force Madeline to rent a room at the hotel, which is dilapidated, cluttered beyond belief, and full of creatures that Mr. Oshiro releases from his body when he doubts himself. You see, Mr. Oshiro is still in denial about his own death, and plays as if the hotel was still in running condition. Madeline, of course, wants to climb, and is only passing through the hotel along the way to her destination, the peak. So, when the pair finally arrive at the Presidential Suite that Mr. Oshiro had been attempting to convince Madeline to rent, he doubles down and insists that she stay. Madeline firmly denies him, but he insists until she is backed into a corner, when finally, Badeline comes out and rebukes him, mocking him cruelly, but saving Madeline from the situation. Mr. Oshiro turns into a snow-monster and chases Madeline until she is cornered on a bridge to nowhere, which Oshiro attacks until it collapses under them both. Thankfully, the fall was short, and this near-death experience is enough to calm Oshiro down, and he tells Madeline to leave, as the hotel is officially closed.
		<br>Madeline runs away up the Golden Ridge, eventually coming across the old lady again, who mocks her once more for giving Oshiro a chance. She presses on and comes across Theo and a gondola over a chasm. She and Theo decide to ride the gondola, and at first they simply chat, however anxiety quickly begins to overtake Madeline, until Badeline appears and stops the gondola right at the middlepoint, leaving them both to teeter over the chasm. This sends Madeline into a panic attack, and Theo, reacting quickly, teaches her a coping strategy by envisioning a feather and attempting to keep it afloat. The player is tasked with playing out this coping strategy by literally controlling Madeline’s breath, and keeping the feather in its place. After Madeline escapes the panic attack, the gondola continues as if nothing had happened to it in the first place, and Theo shows her another selfie he took without her consent (as she was descending into panic, no less. She looks even worse in this one).
		<br>Madeline and Theo press forward until they come across the Mirror Temple, which Theo drags Madeline into, since he wants pictures for his social media. In this temple, Theo gets trapped behind a mirror, and Madeline has to find a way to save him. She does this by traversing the layer into the mirror world herself, which upon doing so confronts her with Badeline once more. The two argue, Madeline upset that she’s being subjected to this by Badeline, while Badeline denies culpability, claiming she warned Madeline to stay away from the Mountain, and that all of what was occurring was simply a reflection of Madeline’s inner world. Eventually, Madeline finds Theo, who has been trapped in a crystal, and saves him from the temple and the tentacled creatures that inhabit it (which bear a resemblance to Dungeons and Dragons’ Beholders).
		<br>After escaping the temple, Theo and Madeline have a long conversation about their own lives and their motives for climbing the mountain. Celeste divulges that she is climbing the mountain to run away from her problems caused by her depression and anxiety and to escape the routine she felt trapped in, and Theo discloses that he’s searching for meaning after having tried and failed to find fulfillment in work. Madeline discloses that she plans on leaving Badeline behind on the mountain, to finally be able to escape from these problems that have been holding her down, and the pair head off to sleep after Theo takes one last selfie with Madeline on the mountain, this one the first time Madeline herself asked for the picture. And this time, she looks like herself in the picture.
		<br>As Madeline drifts off to sleep, she begins to have a dream, where she rides the feathers from her coping mechanism up to the night sky where she floats and finally confronts Badeline, telling her she plans on leaving her behind for good on the mountain. Badeline lashes out and throws Madeline down off of the mountain, casting her into a pit on the side of it into the depths. In the pit, Madeline reflects on everything that’s happened on the mountain and decides that she will forgive Badeline and work with her to climb up to the peak of the mountain. Badeline herself needs convincing, and Madeline has to literally chase her deeper into the pit in order to finally be able to reconcile.
		<br>The final part of the game is Madeline and Badeline working together to climb up the mountain, and they reach the peak together.

                Celeste’s narrative is as subtle as a sledgehammer and as deep as the Madiana Trench. The writing is completely candid about Madeline’s problems. It’s all expo’d during Chapter 6.

                <br>Lesser writing would flounder in such a flagrant flouting of traditional narrative rules. But when Madeline tells her story during the long conversation with Theo at the campfire, we never feel as though we’re missing anything---we don’t feel rushed into the details.

                <br>This is where Celeste bucks traditional narrative and does something only a video game can. The entire gameplay of Celeste is the narrative. Celeste is a highly precise platformer with simple, fluid controls. Each chapter has associated mechanics which build up in difficulty until the end, where you are expected to use each of the mechanics fluently to achieve rather difficult feats of platforming. The final level combines all of these mechanics and becomes much more precise than the preceding ones. These mechanics combine in ways that create some long and arduous platforming challenges for the player, making the game quite difficult (which it has a reputation for being).
            </p3>
            <p4>
                <br>Part of the point of Celeste is to put you in Madeline’s shoes as she climbs the mountains, fighting her doubt every step of the way. The difficulty mirrors this, being so difficult at times to the point where you might die 100 times at one obstacle. This, of course, leads to the player getting disheartened and losing faith in their abilities, much like Madeline does throughout the story. In doing so, the player fills in the missing affective parts of the story that might be teased out and sprung upon them by a novel.
            </p4>
            <p5>
                <br>At every step of the way, the player is engaging in a dialogue with the character of Madeline; simultaneously superhuman, being able to airdash, but almost painfully impotent to overcome obstacles as the player dies over and over again to the same obstacle. The player doubts if they can make it, but they always do, and the game is there to comfort us, urging: “Be proud of your death count! The more you die, the more you’re learning.” In fact, during the final ascent, after a particularly hard section, Madeline herself starts doubting whether she can make it. But Badeline encourages her, telling you “I believe in you.”

                Self-talk is a form of self-forming along the lines of the mirror stage/acoustic mirror stage and is vitally important for understanding the self and world around them. Due to the isolation throughout the game, most characters make sense of their situations only through self-talk. Self-talk is an appeal to the Autre. Read a little bit more before doing this
