            <p1>
                &#9;Celeste’s narrative is as subtle as a sledgehammer and as deep as the Madiana Trench. The writing is completely candid about Madeline’s problems. It’s all expo’d during Chapter 6.

                <br>Lesser writing would flounder in such a flagrant flouting of traditional narrative rules. But when Madeline tells her story during the long conversation with Theo at the campfire, we never feel as though we’re missing anything---we don’t feel rushed into the details.

            <p3>
                <br>&#9;This is where Celeste bucks traditional narrative and does something only a video game can. The entire gameplay of Celeste is the narrative. Celeste is a highly precise platformer with simple, fluid controls. Each chapter has associated mechanics which build up in difficulty until the end, where you are expected to use each of the mechanics fluently to achieve rather difficult feats of platforming. The final level combines all of these mechanics and becomes much more precise than the preceding ones. These mechanics combine in ways that create some long and arduous platforming challenges for the player, making the game quite difficult (which it has a reputation for being).

            <p4>
                <br>&#9;Part of the point of Celeste is to put you in Madeline’s shoes as she climbs the mountains, fighting her doubt every step of the way. The difficulty mirrors this, being so difficult at times to the point where you might die 100 times at one obstacle. This, of course, leads to the player getting disheartened and losing faith in their abilities, much like Madeline does throughout the story. In doing so, the player fills in the missing affective parts of the story that might be teased out and sprung upon them by a novel.

            <p5>
                <br>&#9;At every step of the way, the player is engaging in a dialogue with the character of Madeline; simultaneously superhuman, being able to airdash, but almost painfully impotent to overcome obstacles as the player dies over and over again to the same obstacle. The player doubts if they can make it, but they always do, and the game is there to comfort us, urging: “Be proud of your death count! The more you die, the more you’re learning.” In fact, during the final ascent, after a particularly hard section, Madeline herself starts doubting whether she can make it. But Badeline encourages her, telling you “I believe in you.”

                There is a lot of self-talk

            <p1>
                Self-talk is a form of self-forming along the lines of the mirror stage/acoustic mirror stage and is vitally important for understanding the self and world around them. Due to the isolation throughout the game, most characters make sense of their situations only through self-talk. Self-talk is an appeal to the Autre. Read a little bit more before doing this
